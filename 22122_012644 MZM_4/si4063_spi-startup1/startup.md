PCBite probes on STM pins for Si4063 SPI:
- PB2 = CS/nSEL
- PA7 = SDI
- PA6 = SDO
- PA5 = SCLK

## Startup Capture

### Wait for CTS 

On power up, the MCU should sent the READ_BUFF_CMD (0x44) until the Si4063 sents back a CTS signal (0xFF).

From AN633 Section 7.2 pg 15:

The next image shows the MCU sending READ_CMD_BUFF commands to the Si4063, but NOT receiving the CTS response.

In the Logic 2 capture file ["SI4063_startup1.sal"](SI4063_startup1.sal), the CTS signal is not received until transmit attempt #16 shown below.
